Blackjack is a card game that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one (in our game it will show on the counter as an 11 unless you are over 21). The object of Blackjack is the beat the dealer. This can be accomplished by getting Blackjack (first two cards equal 21) without dealer Blackjack, having your final card count be higher than the dealers without exceeding 21, or by not exceeding 21 and dealer busting by exceeding their card count of 21.

## How the game works
You can find this game [here](https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack) online. Essentially, you're trying to get as close to 21 as possible. All numbered cards have their face score but a Jack, a Queen or a King count as 10. The goal of the game is to add up your cards to the largest number without going over 21. If a card in your hand add up to more than 21, then it's called a bust. It means that you loose immediately. Otherwsise, the player will draw their card and after that the computer will draw its card and the result will be computed.

## How will the winner be decided
The winner will be decided by following criteria:

1. If the computer has a blackjack (first two cards sum to 21) or player went over 21 or the computer score is greater than player's score, then player will loose.
2. If the player has a blackjack or player's score is greater than computer's score, then the player wins
3. If both player and computer ends up with same score, the game is draw.
